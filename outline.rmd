\section{Context - Move Right:}

This document outlines the context, design and technical decisions that inform the development of \textbf{Move Right}, an interactive geo-visualisation dashboard intended to project neighbourhood data to home-buyers in the metropolitan area of Liverpool. Briefly, Move Right is an explorative device constructed using open data and dynamic maps to allows users to discover the most attractive locations to live relative to their personal preferences and financial opportunity. By simpling dragging the cursor over a neighbourhood demarcation, lower super output area (LSOA) boundaries can be explored in depth, providing a rich social observatory from which home-buyers, or other interested parties, can come to decisions regarding the attractiveness of an area to them.
